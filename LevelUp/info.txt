    Topic:NQueens
    4.1: Queen combination 1D (variation to understand NQueens)
    4.2: Queen permutation 1D (variation to understand NQueens)
    4.3: Queen combination 2D (variation to understand NQueens)
    4.4: Queen permutation 2D (variation to understand NQueens)
        With the help of above four we will Finally solve NQueens
    4.5: Finally -> NQueens combination + isItSafe()
    4.6: Finally -> NQueens permutation + isItSafe()
